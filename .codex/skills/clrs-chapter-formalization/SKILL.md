# CLRS Chapter Formalization

Use this skill to turn a CLRS chapter into a maintainable, honest,
theorem-bearing Lean development inside CLRS-Lean.

Core principle: prove as much of the chapter as the current representation can
honestly support.  Do not stop at a proof map when a meaningful Lean theorem can
be stated and proved now.

## Complete-Chapter Workflow

For each chapter, run this loop in order:

1. **Read the local project contract**
   - Read `CLRSLean.lean`, `literate.toml`, `CLRSLean/Status.lean`,
     `docs/proof-map.md`, and the relevant `CLRSLean/Chapter_NN.lean`.
   - Inspect nearby chapter files for naming, namespace, and proof style.

2. **Build a full section inventory**
   - Enumerate every textbook section in the chapter, not only the obvious one.
   - For each section, record: main algorithm/data structure, theorem-like
     textbook claims, proof method, likely Lean model, and status.
   - Do not mark a section `future-work` merely because it is hard.  First ask:
     "Is there a smaller theorem, abstract model, certificate interface, or
     proof-method lemma that can compile now?"

3. **Choose Lean-friendly first models**
   - Prefer pure inductive/list/Finset models before imperative arrays.
   - Prefer mathematical correctness and proof-method theorems before RAM
     semantics, pointer mutation, or low-level performance refinement.
   - For data-structure chapters, separate the mathematical interface from
     executable refinement:
     - Chapter 10: functional stacks, queues, lists, and trees before pointers.
     - Chapter 11: direct-address or abstract hash interfaces before RAM tables.
     - Chapter 12: inductive BSTs before pointer-based tree mutation.
     - Chapter 13: colored-tree invariants and local transformations before
       full red-black insertion/deletion.
   - Make the limitation visible in the section docstring.

4. **Plan proof order**
   - Start with sections whose definitions unlock later sections.
   - Prove proof-method infrastructure before concrete algorithm instances when
     that reduces duplicated work.
   - For each section, define a "best current theorem": the strongest useful
     theorem that should compile without hidden assumptions.

5. **Write the public theorem interface first**
   - Pick theorem names that read like CLRS claims.
   - Make statements strong enough to be useful but small enough to prove.
   - Prefer several small theorems over one massive theorem with opaque
     hypotheses.
   - If exploration needs `sorry`, keep it out of imported chapter files and do
     not list it as `proved`.

6. **Implement and prove section by section**
   - Add the chapter guide file `CLRSLean/Chapter_NN.lean`.
   - Add section files under `CLRSLean/Chapter_NN/`.
   - Keep each file focused: definitions, local lemmas, public theorem block.
   - After each file, run `lake build CLRSLean.Chapter_NN...`.
   - If a proof fails, try at least one of these before deferring:
     - strengthen or expose an invariant;
     - split the theorem into reusable lemmas;
     - use a certificate/interface hypothesis for the missing textbook step;
     - prove a simpler but still useful theorem for the current model.

7. **Wire the book**
   - Import the chapter from `CLRSLean.lean`.
   - Add chapter and section ordering/titles to `literate.toml`.
   - Update `CLRSLean/Status.lean`, `docs/proof-map.md`, and `docs/index.md`.
   - If the chapter is partial, the exact gap must appear in both the Lean
     status page and the proof map.

8. **Verify**
   - Search for accidental unfinished proof markers in theorem-bearing Lean
     files:
     `rg -n '\b(sorry|admit|axiom)\b' CLRSLean/Chapter_NN -g '*.lean'`.
   - Run `git diff --check`.
   - Run `lake build`.
   - For site-visible changes, run `lake build :literateHtml`.
   - If static HTML size matters, run `scripts/optimize_literate_html.py` on a
     temporary copy and inspect large pages.
   - Record warnings as warnings; do not call a chapter complete because a
     different command passed.

9. **Refine this skill after the chapter**
   - Add one concrete lesson learned to the skill or to the iteration log.
   - If the chapter exposed a new reusable pattern, add it to "Chapter Patterns".
   - If the chapter showed a recurring blocker, add it to "Known Blockers".

## Stop Conditions

A chapter pass is complete only when every section is accounted for in source
and status docs:

- `proved`: named Lean theorem(s) compile without `sorry`.
- `partial`: useful theorem infrastructure compiles, and the exact missing
  theorem layer is stated in docs.
- `blocked-design`: at least one concrete modeling/proof attempt revealed a
  representation decision that must be made.
- `deferred-implementation`: low-level implementation correctness is not needed
  for the current mathematical theorem.
- `future-work`: exercises, chapter-end Problems, or strengthenings outside the
  main theorem path.

Red flags: stop and continue proving instead of reporting completion if a
section only has prose, a "planned theorem" could be stated today, or a gap says
"hard" without naming the missing definition, lemma, or representation.

## Required File Shape

Each theorem-bearing section must follow this shape:

```lean
import Mathlib

## Chapter Patterns

- **Functional stack/queue chapters:** use lists as the initial model.  Prove
  equations such as pop-after-push, FIFO behavior, and size preservation.
- **Linked-list chapters without memory semantics:** model the list by `List`
  and prove search soundness, front-insert membership, and deletion membership
  characterizations.  Keep predecessor/successor pointer updates out of the
  proved status until an imperative memory model exists.
- **Lookup-table chapters:** use association lists or direct-address functions
  as the mathematical model.  Prove lookup-after-insert and unaffected-key
  theorems before adding hashing costs.
- **Hash-table performance chapters:** split deterministic correctness from
  expected-time analysis.  First prove bucket/update/search facts for a fixed
  hash function, including deletion/search-after-delete facts; only introduce
  probability once the deterministic interface is stable.
- **Tree chapters:** use inductive trees, an `InTree` predicate, an `Ordered`
  invariant, and theorem names for insertion membership and invariant
  preservation.  Prove a membership-after-insert equivalence before proving
  ordering preservation; it turns bound-preservation lemmas into short
  case splits.  After insertion, prove search correctness and minimum/maximum
  membership plus bound theorems.  Then prove functional successor/predecessor
  as least-greater/greatest-less queries, and prove functional deletion with
  `deleteMin`, `deleteRoot`, membership-after-delete, and ordering-preservation
  theorems before deferring parent-pointer/transplant refinement; these proofs
  are usually structural recursion over the ordered-tree invariant plus
  extremal-key bounds.
- **Balanced-tree chapters:** begin with invariants that can be checked locally:
  node color, no red-red edge, black height, and local rotations.  Full
  insertion/deletion should be marked partial until the balancing algorithm is
  mechanized.  Prove rotation membership preservation before attempting
  invariant preservation for fixup algorithms, then prove red-red local repair
  certificates that combine rotation, root repainting, black-height balance, and
  the bundled shape invariant.
- **Divide-and-conquer recurrence chapters:** formalize proof methods as small,
  reusable theorem templates before attacking every algorithm.  For the
  substitution method, prove base-plus-step upper/lower/sandwich principles and
  common linear or geometric recurrence bounds.  For recursion trees, prove an
  exact finite-sum unrolling theorem and envelope bounds over level costs, then
  instantiate those results for concrete algorithms.
- **Divide-and-conquer selection problems:** when the textbook implementation is
  harder than the mathematical specification, first prove a clean exhaustive
  finite-search specification.  For maximum subarray, enumerate all nonempty
  contiguous subarrays, prove the enumerator exact, prove finite argmax
  optimality, then prove the split classification and an executable one-step
  combiner.  For recursion, use an explicit split tree when direct list
  termination would obscure the main argument; then add a fuelled splitter that
  constructs such trees.  This keeps recursive correctness separate from
  runtime/RAM-cost analysis.
- **Greedy-recursion chapters:** split the proof into three layers before the
  final optimality theorem: sorted-order facts about the greedy choice,
  executable recursion invariants such as sublist and feasibility, and an
  exchange/certificate layer for optimality.  Do not leave executable recursive
  selectors without sublist and feasibility theorems while waiting for the full
  exchange proof.  For activity selection specifically, the automatic exchange
  proof takes a feasible competitor, handles the empty case directly, and in
  the nonempty case uses the greedy head's minimum finish time to show the
  competitor tail belongs to the filtered post-greedy subproblem.
- **MST/Kruskal chapters:** separate the proof into cut-property exchange,
  sorted-order lightness, cycle-test/component exactness, and final spanning
  tree maximality.  If component exactness is not yet available, still prove the
  sorted-order lemma with an explicit processed-prefix exclusion invariant; this
  prevents the section from hiding all of Kruskal's weight-order argument inside
  a certificate hypothesis.  Once exact components are available, prove a prefix
  accounting theorem: every processed edge is either selected or has connected
  endpoints in the current forest.  That theorem should derive the
  processed-prefix exclusion invariant automatically.

## Known Blockers

- Full RAM semantics and pointer mutation are project-level future work.
- Floor/ceiling all-input recurrence proofs need explicit monotonicity and
  sandwich lemmas; exact-power proofs alone are not the full theorem.
- Red-black tree insertion and deletion need a careful balancing representation;
  do not list them as `proved` until Lean proves the executable algorithm
  preserves red-black invariants.
- Hash-table expected-time proofs require a probability model.  Direct-address
  and deterministic collision-chain correctness can be proved before that.
- Chapter-end exercises and Problems belong to a second track after the main
  chapter interface is stable.

## Iteration Log

- Chapter 11/12/13 cleanup pass: do not leave deterministic query theorems in
  prose once the functional model exists.  For hash tables, prove an
  insertion-search iff before moving to probability.  For BSTs, prove search
  equivalence and extremal-key bounds before successor/deletion.  For local
  tree transformations, prove both invariant preservation and membership
  preservation so the public interface is complete enough for later algorithms.
- Proof-status audit pass: remove prose that implies imported files may contain
  `sorry`; record unfinished theorem targets in status ledgers instead.  When a
  chapter has several small local invariants, add a bundled predicate/theorem so
  later algorithm proofs have one clear interface rather than scattered facts.
- Chapter 12 successor/predecessor pass: when pointer algorithms are not yet in
  scope, prove the pure functional query theorem anyway: returned successors are
  tree members, strictly greater than the query, and least among greater keys;
  predecessors use the symmetric greatest-less statement.
- Chapter 12 deletion pass: after functional successor/predecessor, prove the
  pure deletion layer instead of leaving it as prose.  Useful public theorems are
  membership-after-delete and ordering preservation; keep only parent-pointer,
  transplant, and pointer mutation as the remaining CLRS refinement layer.
- Chapter 4.1 maximum-subarray pass: do not wait for the divide-and-conquer
  recurrence before proving the core specification.  A finite exhaustive
  selector plus an exact contiguous-subarray enumerator gives a strong public
  theorem and a precise future refinement target.
- Chapter 4.1 executable-combine pass: after the left/right/crossing
  classification is proved, add the executable combine step immediately.
  Selecting among `maxSubarray left`, `maxSubarray right`, and
  `maxCrossingSubarray left right` gives a compact theorem,
  `maxSubarrayDivideStep_correct`, and removes local optimality from the future
  recursive proof.
- Chapter 4.1 recursive-selector pass: once the one-step combiner is sealed,
  introduce a result predicate for optional selectors, prove the combiner
  preserves it, and recurse over an explicit split tree.  A fuelled midpoint
  tree gives an executable divide-and-conquer selector without fighting
  termination before the runtime model exists.
- Chapter 16.1 activity-selection pass: before proving maximum cardinality,
  prove the finish-sorted head lemma and the executable greedy selector's
  sublist and feasibility invariants.  These are small theorem layers that make
  the remaining exchange-certificate gap much sharper.
- Chapter 11.2 chained-hashing pass: do not leave deletion as prose while
  expected-time analysis is blocked.  A fixed-hash functional model can still
  prove bucket delete, search-after-delete failure, and the full
  `hashSearch_hashDelete_iff` characterization.
- Chapter 13 red-black local-repair pass: after rotation membership and root
  repainting, prove the red-red rotation repair certificates that future
  fixup algorithms need.  Good public theorem targets combine child subtree
  `RedBlackShape` hypotheses, matching black-height assumptions, rotation, and
  repainting the new root black.
- Chapter 3.2 standard-function pass: when a CLRS growth-table entry already
  exists in Mathlib, add a small CLRS-facing wrapper theorem instead of leaving
  it as prose.  Log-vs-polynomial, polynomial-vs-exponential, and
  exponential-base comparisons are good examples of one-lemma bridges that
  materially shrink a `partial` gap.
- Chapter 3.2 harmonic-number pass: use Mathlib convergence/bounds theorems to
  prove CLRS-facing asymptotic wrappers, then update downstream chapter gaps
  that depended on the missing standard-function fact.  In particular, after
  `H_n = Θ(log n)` is proved in Chapter 3.2, Chapter 5 should expose its own
  expected-hires Θ theorem or remove the old future-work item once that wrapper
  exists.
- Downstream asymptotic-wrapper pass: when a section has already proved an
  exact closed form and another chapter proves that closed form's asymptotics,
  add the section-level theorem immediately.  Do not leave a `future-work`
  entry saying "connect these" once the bridge is a short equality plus
  `isBigTheta_trans`.
- Activity-selection exchange pass: after sorted-head and recursive
  sublist/feasibility lemmas exist, prove the certificate constructor from
  sorted order and immediately compose it into the public
  `greedySelect_maxCardinality` theorem.  The certificate theorem should remain
  as a reusable interface, but the status page should not keep the section
  `partial` once the sorted-list optimality theorem compiles.
- Chapter 23.2 sorted-lightness pass: for Kruskal, prove the weight-order
  argument before the full component exactness model.  A useful theorem shape is
  sorted edge list plus "no previously processed edge crosses the current cut"
  implies the current edge is light, then package it as a component-oracle cut
  certificate.  The next real gap becomes deriving that prefix exclusion from
  cycle-test/component exactness, not sortedness itself.
- Chapter 23.2 exact-component pass: after the sorted-lightness layer, add a
  prefix accounting theorem for the real Kruskal recursion.  With exact
  components, a rejected processed edge has connected endpoints, and an accepted
  processed edge remains in the growing forest; either way it cannot cross the
  current exact component cut.  This moves the remaining MST gap to concrete
  exchange edges, final spanning-tree construction, and optional union-find
  refinement.

## Honesty Rules

- A `proved` status requires a named Lean theorem that compiles without `sorry`.
- A section can be valuable while `partial`; make the boundary precise.
- Never import a non-compiler-clean exploration file into `CLRSLean.lean`.
- Prefer a smaller theorem that compiles over a grand theorem with hidden
  assumptions.
- Do not wait for the user to ask for the next section when a chapter pass has
  remaining tractable proof targets; move to the next proof target autonomously.
