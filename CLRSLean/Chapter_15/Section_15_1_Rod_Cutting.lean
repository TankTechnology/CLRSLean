# CLRS Section 15.1 - Rod cutting

This section formalizes the mathematical core of the rod-cutting dynamic
program.  Instead of committing immediately to one array implementation, it
defines the Bellman first-cut recurrence as a specification for a revenue
function.  The main theorem proves that any revenue function satisfying that
recurrence upper-bounds the value of every concrete cutting plan.  Consequently,
any plan whose value attains the recurrence value is optimal among plans of the
same total length.

Main results:

* Theorem {lit}`firstCutValue_le_of_rodCutRecurrence`: every admissible first
  cut is bounded by the recurrence value.
* Theorem {lit}`rodRevenue_le_of_firstCutValue_bounds`: the recurrence value is
  the least upper bound induced by first-cut candidates.
* Theorem {lit}`bottomUpRodRevenue_rodCutRecurrence`: the executable
  recurrence-valued rod-cutting function satisfies the CLRS Bellman recurrence.
* Theorem {lit}`planValue_le_table_of_rodCutTableRecurrence`: any finite table
  filled by the bottom-up recurrence is an upper bound for every positive-piece
  cutting plan within its filled prefix.
* Theorem {lit}`planValue_le_revenue_of_rodCutRecurrence`: every positive-piece
  cutting plan is bounded by the recurrence value of its total length.
* Theorem {lit}`planValue_le_optimalPlanValue_of_same_length`: a plan attaining
  the recurrence value is optimal among plans of the same length.

Current gaps:

* This file proves the mathematical bottom-up table-certificate layer, but not
  yet a mutable-array implementation or memoized cache refinement.
* Matrix-chain multiplication, LCS, and optimal binary-search trees remain
  future dynamic-programming targets.

/-- The total length of a concrete cutting plan. -/
def planLength (pieces : List Nat) : Nat :=
  pieces.sum

/-- The value of a cutting plan under the given price table. -/
def planValue (price : Nat → Nat) (pieces : List Nat) : Nat :=
  (pieces.map price).sum

/-- Every piece in the cutting plan has positive length. -/
def PositivePieces (pieces : List Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ piece, piece ∈ pieces → 0 < piece

/-- The value obtained by making {lit}`cut` the first cut of a rod of length {lit}`n`. -/
def FirstCutValue (price revenue : Nat → Nat) (n cut : Nat) : Nat :=
  price cut + revenue (n - cut)

/--
The CLRS rod-cutting recurrence: length zero has value zero, and every positive
length is the maximum over all possible first cuts.

    ∀ n, revenue (n + 1) =

        (fun cut => FirstCutValue price revenue (n + 1) cut)

/-! ## Bottom-up table and executable recurrence -/

/--
A finite bottom-up rod-cutting table is correct through {lit}`limit` when entry
zero is zero and every positive entry up to {lit}`limit` is filled by the CLRS
first-cut recurrence using earlier table entries.

        (Finset.Icc 1 (n + 1)).sup
          (fun cut => FirstCutValue price table (n + 1) cut)

/--
The canonical executable rod-cutting value function obtained by recursively
evaluating the CLRS first-cut recurrence.  The recurrence is written over
{lit}`Finset.attach` so Lean sees that each recursive call is made at a strictly
smaller rod length.
