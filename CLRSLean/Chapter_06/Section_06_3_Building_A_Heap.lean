# CLRS Section 6.3 - Building a Heap

This section proves the indexed version of CLRS {lit}`BUILD-MAX-HEAP`.  The
main builder starts from the last internal-node layer and repeatedly calls the
fuelled {lit}`MAX-HEAPIFY` theorem from Section 6.2.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`ArrayMaxHeapFrom.of_half`: every node from {lit}`heapSize / 2`
  onward is a leaf, so that suffix is already a localized max-heap.
- Theorem {lit}`buildMaxHeapLoop_isMaxHeap`: the bottom-up repeated
  {lit}`MAX-HEAPIFY` loop returns a global indexed max-heap.
- Theorem {lit}`buildMaxHeapLoop_perm`: the bottom-up loop preserves the input
  multiset.
- Theorem {lit}`arrayBuildMaxHeap_isMaxHeap`: the array-facing builder returns
  an indexed max-heap over the whole list.
- Theorem {lit}`arrayBuildMaxHeap_perm`: the builder preserves the multiset of
  input elements.
- Theorem {lit}`arrayBuildMaxHeap_correct`: the reader-facing correctness
  theorem bundling heapness, permutation, and length preservation.

Remaining refinements:

- This section proves the CLRS-style bottom-up heap construction used by the
  in-place heapsort loop.  Later work can connect it to a shared imperative
  array semantics and cost model.

Bottom-up heap construction loop.  With count {lit}`k + 1`, it first heapifies
index {lit}`k`, then continues with {lit}`k - 1`, and so on down to zero.

        (maxHeapifyFuel_perm heapSize a heapSize count)

/--
Every parent index from {lit}`heapSize / 2` onward is a leaf.  This is the
zero-based version of the CLRS observation that nodes after
{lit}`⌊heap-size / 2⌋` are leaves.
-/
theorem ArrayMaxHeapFrom.of_half {a : List Nat} {heapSize : Nat}
    (hlen : heapSize ≤ a.length) :
    ArrayMaxHeapFrom a heapSize (heapSize / 2) := by
  refine ⟨hlen, ?_, ?_⟩

    exfalso
    unfold left at hl
    omega
  · intro i hhalf _ hr
    exfalso
    unfold right at hr
    omega

/--
If all localized heap obligations after {lit}`i` hold, then the same localized
region starting at {lit}`i` has at most one bad parent, namely {lit}`i` itself.
-/
theorem ArrayMaxHeapFrom.except_pred {a : List Nat} {heapSize i : Nat}
    (h : ArrayMaxHeapFrom a heapSize (i + 1)) :
    ArrayMaxHeapExceptFrom a heapSize i i := by

  · intro j hij hj hji hr
    have hnext : i + 1 ≤ j := by omega
    exact h.right_le hnext hj hr

/--
Correctness of the bottom-up build loop.  If the suffix of parent obligations
from {lit}`count` onward is already a localized heap, heapifying
{lit}`count - 1, ..., 0` produces a global max-heap.
