# CLRS Section 16.1 - Activity selection

This file gives a first Lean model for the activity-selection problem from
CLRS Section 16.1.  Activities are closed-open intervals over natural-number
time points, represented only by their {lit}`start` and {lit}`finish` fields.  A selected
list is feasible when every earlier activity in the list finishes before every
later one starts.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`earliest_finish_minFinish`: the executable selector
  {lit}`earliest_finish` returns an activity whose finish time is minimum in the
  input list.
- Theorem {lit}`finishSorted_head_minFinish`: the head of a finish-time-sorted
  nonempty activity list is the earliest-finishing available activity.
- Theorem {lit}`greedy_choice_minFinish_preserves_optimal_tail_feasibility`: if the
  greedy activity is compatible with an optimal tail solution, prepending it is
  feasible.
- Theorem {lit}`greedy_choice_optimal_from_certificate`: a certificate-based
  optimality theorem for the greedy-choice step.  The exchange argument is
  provided as a hypothesis, keeping the theorem honest while still matching the
  CLRS proof structure.
- Theorem {lit}`finishSorted_greedyChoiceCertificate`: on a finish-time-sorted
  candidate list, the CLRS exchange certificate is derived automatically.
- Theorem {lit}`greedySelect_cons_eq`: the executable selector follows the
  CLRS recursive cons-case equation: choose the first finishing activity and
  recurse on the filtered compatible tail.
- Theorems {lit}`greedySelect_sublist` and {lit}`greedySelect_feasible`: the
  executable greedy selector always returns activities drawn from the input and
  arranged feasibly.
- Theorem {lit}`greedySelect_maxCardinality`: on a finish-time-sorted input, the
  executable greedy selector has maximum cardinality among feasible sublists.
- Theorem {lit}`greedySelect_cons_maxCardinality`: the nonempty sorted-input
  recursion theorem, exposing the greedy choice plus optimal recursive
  subproblem directly.
- Theorem {lit}`greedySelect_after_maxCardinality`: the filtered compatible tail
  is itself solved optimally by the same executable selector.
- Theorem {lit}`greedySelect_optimal_length`: a direct reader-facing corollary:
  every feasible sublist of a finish-time-sorted input has length at most the
  greedy output.
- Definition {lit}`activitySelection`: the CLRS-facing name for the executable
  greedy selector.
- Theorems {lit}`activitySelection_maxCardinality` and
  {lit}`activitySelection_cons_maxCardinality`: top-level maximum-cardinality
  certificates for the full input and the nonempty recursive step.
- Theorems {lit}`activitySelection_correct` and
  {lit}`activitySelection_cons_correct`: reader-facing correctness bundles for
  the full sorted-list input and the nonempty recursive step.
- Theorems {lit}`greedySelect_cons_recursive_correct` and
  {lit}`activitySelection_cons_recursive_correct`: bundled nonempty recursion
  theorems that expose the exact cons-case equation, optimal recursive tail,
  optimal full solution, feasibility, sublist membership, and optimal-length
  inequality in one statement.

Current gaps:

- None for the current finite-list model.  A lower-level refinement to CLRS
  array/pseudocode execution and richer interval-validity assumptions remains a
  future extension.
