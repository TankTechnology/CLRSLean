# CLRS Section 12.1 - Binary search trees

This section gives a first Lean model of binary search trees as inductive trees
of natural-number keys.  It proves the fundamental search and insertion facts
used by the textbook invariant argument: search is correct on ordered trees,
minimum and maximum return genuine extremal keys, insertion adds exactly the
inserted key to the membership set, and insertion preserves the BST ordering
invariant.  It also proves functional successor and predecessor queries: the
successor is the least key greater than the query, and the predecessor is the
greatest key less than the query.  Finally, it proves a functional deletion
operation that removes exactly the requested key and preserves ordering.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`search_eq_true_iff`: Boolean search is equivalent to tree
  membership on ordered trees.
- Theorem {lit}`minimum?_inTree`: a returned minimum key occurs in the tree.
- Theorem {lit}`minimum?_le_of_ordered`: a returned minimum key is a lower bound
  on an ordered tree.
- Theorem {lit}`maximum?_inTree`: a returned maximum key occurs in the tree.
- Theorem {lit}`le_maximum?_of_ordered`: a returned maximum key is an upper
  bound on an ordered tree.
- Theorem {lit}`successor?_least_greater`: a returned successor is the least
  tree key strictly greater than the query.
- Theorem {lit}`successor?_eq_some_iff`: complete iff specification for a
  returned successor.
- Theorem {lit}`successor?_eq_none_iff`: complete none specification for a
  missing successor.
- Theorem {lit}`successor?_isSome_iff_exists_greater`: successor existence is
  equivalent to the existence of a greater tree key.
- Theorem {lit}`predecessor?_greatest_less`: a returned predecessor is the
  greatest tree key strictly less than the query.
- Theorem {lit}`predecessor?_eq_some_iff`: complete iff specification for a
  returned predecessor.
- Theorem {lit}`predecessor?_eq_none_iff`: complete none specification for a
  missing predecessor.
- Theorem {lit}`predecessor?_isSome_iff_exists_less`: predecessor existence is
  equivalent to the existence of a smaller tree key.
- Theorem {lit}`inTree_insert_iff`: membership after insertion is exactly the
  old membership relation plus the inserted key.
- Theorem {lit}`search_insert_eq_true_iff`: searching after insertion succeeds
  exactly for the inserted key or an old key.
- Theorem {lit}`insert_ordered`: insertion preserves the BST ordering invariant.
- Theorem {lit}`inTree_delete_iff`: functional deletion removes exactly the
  requested key.
- Theorem {lit}`delete_ordered`: functional deletion preserves the BST ordering
  invariant.
- Theorem {lit}`not_inTree_delete_self`: the deleted key is absent afterward.
- Theorem {lit}`delete_eq_self_of_not_inTree`: deleting a missing key leaves an
  ordered tree unchanged.
- Theorem {lit}`search_delete_self_eq_false`: searching for the deleted key
  after deletion returns false.
- Theorem {lit}`search_delete_eq_true_iff`: searching after deletion succeeds
  exactly for old keys different from the deleted key.
- Theorem {lit}`successor?_delete_eq_some_iff`: after deletion, the returned
  successor is the least old key above the query and different from the deleted
  key.
- Theorem {lit}`successor?_delete_eq_none_iff`: after deletion, no successor is
  returned exactly when every old key except the deleted key is at most the
  query.
- Theorem {lit}`predecessor?_delete_eq_some_iff`: after deletion, the returned
  predecessor is the greatest old key below the query and different from the
  deleted key.
- Theorem {lit}`predecessor?_delete_eq_none_iff`: after deletion, no
  predecessor is returned exactly when every old key except the deleted key is
  at least the query.

Current gaps:

- Parent-pointer successor/predecessor procedures, transplant, and pointer-level
  tree mutation are future section targets.
