# Chapter 12 - Binary Search Trees

Chapter 12 studies binary search trees and the operations that preserve their
ordering invariant.  The current CLRS-Lean pass uses an inductive tree of natural
keys and proves search, minimum/maximum, and insertion correctness for
membership and ordering.

## Sections

* 12.1 Binary search trees: `partial`.
  Main results: {lit}`CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.search_eq_true_iff`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.minimum?_le_of_ordered`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.le_maximum?_of_ordered`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.inTree_insert_iff`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.insert_ordered`.

## Current Gaps

Predecessor/successor, transplant, and deletion are not yet formalized.  The
pointer-transplant algorithm from CLRS needs an imperative tree model or a
separate functional deletion theorem.
