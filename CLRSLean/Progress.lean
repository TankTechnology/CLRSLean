# Progress Dashboard

This page is the public, reader-facing progress dashboard for CLRS-Lean.
The machine-readable source of truth is {lit}`docs/clrs-proof-progress.csv`.
When the CSV changes, regenerate this page with
{lit}`python3 scripts/check_progress_csv.py --write-dashboard`.

## Snapshot

* CLRS chapters tracked: 35.
* Chapters represented in Lean: 19.
* Tracked reader-facing theorem entries: 561.
* Proved tracked theorem entries: 561.
* Remaining core theorem groups: 45.

Tracked theorem entries count the public theorem groups currently represented
in Lean.  Remaining core theorem groups count textbook-facing targets that
are not yet represented or not yet complete.

## Status Counts

* {lit}`main-proof-complete`: 2 chapters.
* {lit}`main-proof-complete-for-correctness`: 1 chapter.
* {lit}`selected-section-complete`: 3 chapters.
* {lit}`partial`: 12 chapters.
* {lit}`not-started`: 16 chapters.
* {lit}`expository`: 1 chapter.

## Agent Update Rule

Every theorem-producing agent should treat this table as part of the proof
artifact, not as a separate report.  If a contribution adds, removes,
renames, strengthens, or finishes a reader-facing theorem group, update
{lit}`docs/clrs-proof-progress.csv` in the same commit.  If the change
alters the public snapshot or chapter rows, regenerate this page before
building the site.

Minimum maintenance loop:

1. Update the relevant chapter/section Lean files and {lit}`docs/clrs-proof-progress.csv`.
2. Run {lit}`python3 scripts/check_progress_csv.py --write-dashboard`.
3. Run {lit}`lake build CLRSLean` and, for website changes, {lit}`lake build :literateHtml`.
