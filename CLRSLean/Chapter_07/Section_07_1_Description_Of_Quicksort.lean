# CLRS Section 7.1 - Description of quicksort

This file starts the Chapter 7 sorting track with a Lean-friendly functional
model of quicksort.  The CLRS in-place partition procedure is represented by a
stable partition around a pivot; the current theorem layer proves the same
mathematical facts used by the textbook proof:

* partition returns exactly the original tail elements;
* the left partition contains only elements at most the pivot;
* the right partition contains only elements greater than the pivot;
* functional quicksort returns an ordered permutation of the input.

The in-place array partition loop and the randomized/expected-time analysis are
separate strengthening targets.

Reader-facing correctness theorem for stable partition around a pivot.

It packages the facts used by the quicksort proof: the left side contains
exactly the input elements at most the pivot, the right side contains exactly
the input elements greater than the pivot, and concatenating the two sides is a
permutation of the original input tail.
