# CLRS Section 7.1 - Description of quicksort

This file starts the Chapter 7 sorting track with a Lean-friendly functional
model of quicksort and a scan-state proof spine for the CLRS partition loop.
The theorem layer proves the same mathematical facts used by the textbook
proof:

* partition returns exactly the original tail elements;
* the left partition contains only elements at most the pivot;
* the right partition contains only elements greater than the pivot;
* the scan-state partition loop preserves its exact invariant and computes the
  same regions as the specification partition;
* an array-facing wrapper returns a pivot index whose prefix/suffix satisfy the
  CLRS partition postcondition;
* the array-facing partition output is reachable from the input by an explicit
  finite adjacent-swap trace;
* functional quicksort returns an ordered permutation of the input.

The remaining array-level strengthening target is to refine this proof to a
concrete index-level mutable array-segment loop.  Randomized/expected-time
analysis is also separate.

It packages the returned-index postcondition: the pivot is in bounds and stored
at the returned index; the prefix before it is at most the pivot; the suffix
after it is greater than the pivot; and the output is a permutation of the
pivot followed by the scanned tail.

Array-facing partition correctness with an explicit adjacent-swap trace.

This strengthens {lit}`clrsPartitionArray_correct` by recording that the output
segment is not merely a permutation of the input segment, but is reachable by a
finite sequence of adjacent swaps.
