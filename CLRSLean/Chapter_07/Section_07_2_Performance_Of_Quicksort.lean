# CLRS Section 7.2 - Performance of quicksort

This section defines a deterministic comparison-count cost model for the
first-pivot functional quicksort from Section 7.1 and proves a quadratic upper
bound: on any list of length {lit}`n`, quicksort performs at most {lit}`n²`
comparisons.

The cost model mirrors the fuelled recursion of {lit}`quickSortFuel`: each
non-empty call compares every tail element against the pivot (one comparison
each) and then adds the recursive comparison counts for the left and right
partitions.

Main results:

- Lemma {lit}`partitionAround_length_add`: the two partition halves together have
  exactly the length of the scanned tail.
- Theorem {lit}`quickSortComparisons_quadratic`: for any list {lit}`xs`,
  {lit}`quickSortComparisons xs ≤ xs.length * xs.length`.

Notation conventions:

- {lit}`partitionAround p xs` : the stable partition from Section 7.1
- {lit}`quickSortComparisonsFuel fuel xs` : fuelled comparison counter
- {lit}`quickSortComparisons xs` : total comparison count with full fuel

/-! ## Comparison-count cost model -/

/--
Fuelled comparison counter that mirrors the recursion structure of
{lit}`quickSortFuel`.

Each non-empty call adds {lit}`xs.length` comparisons (one per tail element tested
against the pivot) to the recursive comparison counts for the left and right
partition halves.

  | _ + 1, [] => 0
  | fuel + 1, pivot :: xs =>
      let parts := partitionAround pivot xs
      xs.length + quickSortComparisonsFuel fuel parts.1 +
        quickSortComparisonsFuel fuel parts.2

/--
Total number of comparisons performed by functional quicksort on a list.

Uses exactly {lit}`xs.length` fuel, matching the public {lit}`quickSort`
definition so that {lit}`quickSortComparisons xs` counts the comparisons in
{lit}`quickSort xs`.

def quickSortComparisons (xs : List Nat) : Nat :=
  quickSortComparisonsFuel xs.length xs

/-! ## Partition length conservation -/

/--
The two halves of a pivot partition together contain every element of the
scanned tail.  This is an immediate consequence of
{lit}`partitionAround_perm`.

    (partitionAround p xs).1.length + (partitionAround p xs).2.length = xs.length := by
  have hperm := partitionAround_perm p xs
  have hlen := hperm.length_eq
  simpa [List.length_append] using hlen

/-! ## Quadratic upper bound -/

/--
When the fuel is at least the list length, the comparison count of quicksort is
bounded by the square of the list length.

The proof mimics the fuel induction in {lit}`quickSortFuel_perm`: the left and right
partition lengths are bounded by the tail length, and the inductive hypotheses
give {lit}`≤ a²` and {lit}`≤ b²` bounds.  A {lit}`nlinarith` step then closes
the algebraic gap {lit}`(a+b) + a² + b² ≤ (a+b+1)²`.

/--
**Quadratic upper bound for quicksort comparisons.**  On any list {lit}`xs` of
length {lit}`n`, functional first-pivot quicksort performs at most {lit}`n²`
comparisons.

This corresponds to the deterministic worst-case analysis in CLRS Section 7.2.
