# Chapter 3. Growth of Functions

CLRS introduces asymptotic notation — O, Ω, Θ, o, ω — as the language for
describing how running times grow with input size.  This chapter bridges the
textbook definitions to mathlib's filter-based asymptotics library.

## 3.1 Asymptotic Notation

Defines O, Ω, Θ, o, ω as CLRS-style wrappers around mathlib's
`=O[atTop]` / `=o[atTop]`.  Proves equivalence between the CLRS discrete
definition (`∃ c n₀`) and the filter-based one.  Collects algebraic
properties: reflexivity, transitivity, sum and product rules.

## 3.2 Standard Functions

Proves concrete growth comparisons that matter for algorithm analysis:
* polynomial `n^a` vs exponential `c^n` for every `c > 1`
* logarithm powers `(log n)^a` vs polynomial `n^ε`
* exponential base comparisons `a^n = o(b^n)` for `0 ≤ a < b`
* harmonic numbers `H_n ~ log n` and `H_n = Θ(log n)`
* factorial upper/lower bounds, exponential-vs-factorial comparison, and
  `n! = o(n^n)`
* floor / ceiling Θ-behavior, including half-scale floor and ceiling

Notation: we use `|·|` (absolute value) rather than `‖·‖` for readability.
