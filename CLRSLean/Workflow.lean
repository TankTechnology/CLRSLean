# Workflow

CLRS-Lean uses a repeatable section workflow.  The goal is to make future
chapters easy to audit, easy to deploy, and pleasant to read.

## Section Lifecycle

1. Textbook map.
2. Algorithm model.
3. Mathematical proof plan.
4. Lean theorem interface.
5. Lean proof.
6. Verification.
7. Site and status update.

## 1. Textbook Map

Record the section number, algorithm, main theorem-like claims, proof method,
and any exercises or chapter-end problems.  Exercises are normally marked
{lit}`future-work` until the main theorem interface is stable.

## 2. Algorithm Model

Choose the Lean model that exposes the proof cleanly.  Prefer a mathematical
model first: lists for sorting, finite sets for edge collections, abstract
oracles for cycle tests, and recurrence functions for first-pass runtime
arguments.

Implementation-level refinements such as arrays, heaps, priority queues, and
union-find can refine the mathematical model later.

## 3. Mathematical Proof Plan

Write the proof as small claims before proving them in Lean.  Typical patterns
include:

* sortedness plus permutation preservation;
* loop invariant over a state relation;
* exchange argument;
* cut property;
* recurrence solution;
* optimal-substructure lower bound.

## 4. Lean Interface

Expose theorem names that a reader would search for.  A section should have a
small public surface even if the local proof needs many helper lemmas.

Example:

```lean
#check CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_sorted
#check CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_perm
```

## 5. Lean Proof

Keep early proofs local and readable.  Extract shared abstractions only after at
least two sections need the same interface.  This keeps the site from developing
premature infrastructure that readers must understand before they can read a
single algorithm.

## 6. Verification

Use narrow checks while editing, then a project-level build before publishing:

* {lit}`lake env lean CLRSLean/Chapter_02/Section_02_1_Insertion_Sort.lean`
* {lit}`lake env lean Tests/Chapter_02_Interface.lean`
* {lit}`lake build`
* {lit}`lake build :literateHtml`

When local {lit}`literateHtml` generation is too slow, the Lean build and static
configuration checks still provide useful evidence, and the GitHub Pages build
becomes the final deployment gate.

## 7. Site and Status Update

Every user-facing section change should update the book structure:

* the relevant {lit}`CLRSLean/Chapter_XX.lean` chapter page;
* {lit}`CLRSLean/Status.lean` if the proof status changed;
* {lit}`literate.toml` if a new module should appear in the navigation;
* {lit}`docs/proof-map.md` for the longer maintainer ledger.
