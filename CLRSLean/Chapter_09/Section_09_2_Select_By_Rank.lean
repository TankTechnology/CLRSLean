# CLRS Section 9.2 - Selection by rank

This file gives the first Chapter 9 correctness interface: a selector returns
an element with the requested zero-based order statistic.  The implementation is
the simple specification program obtained by sorting and indexing; randomized
or deterministic linear-time SELECT can later refine to this interface.

The public certificate is phrased by counts, so duplicates are handled in the
usual order-statistic way: if the selected value is {lit}`x`, then at most
{lit}`k` elements are strictly smaller than {lit}`x`, and more than {lit}`k`
elements are at most {lit}`x`.
