# CLRS Section 9.3 - Deterministic selection

This file factors the Chapter 9 selection proof through a pivot-parametric
interface.  The key point is pure correctness rather than running time: any
pivot rule that returns an element of the current input list yields a selector
whose successful result satisfies the same count-based rank certificate used in
Section 9.2.

Main results:

* Theorem {lit}`selectWithPivot?_correct`: a pivot-parametric SELECT is rank
  correct whenever the pivot rule returns members of the current list.
* Theorem {lit}`medianOfFive?_certificate`: the median selected from a
  five-element group has at least three elements below it weakly and at least
  three elements above it weakly.
* Theorems {lit}`medianGroupCertificates_leCount_lower_bound` and
  {lit}`medianGroupCertificates_geCount_lower_bound`: a collection of certified
  five-element groups contributes three original elements for every group
  median on the corresponding side of a pivot.
* Theorem {lit}`fullGroupsOfFive_medianPivot_split_counts`: the executable
  full-grouping wrapper constructs the certificates and obtains the split
  counts for a median of the group medians.
* Theorem {lit}`fullGroupsOfFive_medianPivot_fullInput_split_counts`: the
  grouped split counts lift to the original input list because the flattened
  full groups are a sublist of the input.
* Theorem {lit}`fullGroupsOfFive_medianPivot_partition_size_bound`: both
  strict recursive branches around the pivot satisfy the familiar
  {lit}`7n/10 + O(1)` CLRS size bound.
* Theorem {lit}`deterministicSelect?_correct`: a deterministic median-pivot
  instance is rank correct.

Current gaps:

* This is not yet the CLRS linear-time median-of-medians cost theorem.  The
  local five-element median certificate, executable grouping wrapper, grouped
  split-count core, full-input median-pivot split-count wrapper, and
  {lit}`7n/10` partition-size packaging are proved below; the remaining hard
  proof is the associated linear recurrence.

A pivot function is membership-safe when every pivot it returns is an element
of the current input list.

def PivotMembership (choosePivot? : List Nat → Option Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ {xs : List Nat} {pivot : Nat}, choosePivot? xs = some pivot → pivot ∈ xs

/--
Fuelled SELECT with an abstract deterministic pivot rule.

The algorithm mirrors the CLRS three-way partition around the chosen pivot:
recurse on elements below the pivot, return the pivot block when the requested
rank falls inside it, or recurse on elements above the pivot after shifting the
rank by the number of elements at most the pivot.

Correctness of the fuelled pivot-parametric SELECT.

If the pivot function is membership-safe and the computation returns {lit}`x`,
then {lit}`x` is a valid zero-based order statistic certificate for the
original input.

three group elements are at most it, and at least three group elements are at
least it.

Certificates pairing each full five-element group with its selected median.

usable for both executable median-of-medians code and later lower-level array
refinements.

The fuel is only a termination device; the public wrapper below uses
{lit}`xs.length`, so the function is executable while keeping the proof
obligations straightforward.

If {lit}`pivot` has rank certificate {lit}`k` among the group medians, then the
original grouped values have at least {lit}`3 * (k + 1)` elements at most the
pivot and at least {lit}`3 * (medians.length - k)` elements at least the pivot.

This is the reusable counting core of the CLRS median-of-medians split-size
argument; the executable wrappers below convert it to the familiar
{lit}`7n/10 + O(1)` branch-size bound.
