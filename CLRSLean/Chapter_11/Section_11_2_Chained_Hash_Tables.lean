# CLRS Section 11.2 - Chained hash tables

This section gives a deterministic correctness layer for chained hash tables.
The table is a function from bucket indices to lists of keys.  The hash function
decides the bucket, insertion conses the key onto that bucket, and deletion
filters the key from that same bucket.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`bucket_hashInsert_same`: the inserted key appears in its hash
  bucket.
- Theorem {lit}`bucket_hashInsert_other`: buckets with a different index are
  unchanged.
- Theorem {lit}`hashSearch_hashInsert_self`: after insertion, searching for the
  inserted key succeeds.
- Theorem {lit}`hashSearch_hashInsert_iff`: after insertion, searching for any
  query succeeds exactly when it is the inserted key or was already present.
- Theorem {lit}`hashSearch_hashDelete_self`: after deletion, searching for the
  deleted key fails.
- Theorem {lit}`hashSearch_hashDelete_iff`: after deletion, searching for any
  query succeeds exactly when it is different from the deleted key and was
  already present.
- Theorem {lit}`expectedSearchChainLength_eq_loadFactor`: in the finite-uniform
  bucket model, expected chain length is exactly the load factor.
- Theorem {lit}`expectedUnsuccessfulSearchCost_finiteHashInsert`: inserting one
  key increases expected unsuccessful-search cost by {lit}`1/m`.

Current gaps:

- This file proves the finite-uniform bucket interface for expected chain
  length.  A full probability model over independently random hash functions is
  still future work.

/-- A chained hash table maps bucket indices to lists of stored keys. -/

Delete every copy of a key from the bucket selected by the hash function.  This
is the deterministic functional analogue of CLRS chained-hash deletion; pointer
updates inside a linked list are intentionally outside this model.
