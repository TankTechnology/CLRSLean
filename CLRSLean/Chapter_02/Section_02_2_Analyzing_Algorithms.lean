# CLRS Section 2.2 - Analyzing algorithms

This file records the first lightweight cost model used in the Chapter 2
workflow.  It does not try to formalize a full RAM model yet.  Instead it
captures the standard insertion-sort worst-case comparison count as a triangular
sum and proves a quadratic upper bound.
