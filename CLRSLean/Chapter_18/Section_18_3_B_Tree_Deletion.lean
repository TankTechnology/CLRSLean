# CLRS Section 18.3 - B-tree deletion specification

This section adds a first-pass deletion specification over the mathematical
B-tree key-membership model.  It deliberately stays at the set-membership layer:
the operation filters the represented key list and later refinements can replace
it with the full CLRS node-level borrow/merge algorithm.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_preserves_model`: specification deletion preserves
  the first-pass validity predicate.
- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_mem_iff`: after deletion, membership is exactly
  membership of a key different from the deleted key.
- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_search_iff`: searching after deletion succeeds
  exactly for old searchable keys different from the deleted key.
- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_search_false_iff`: searching after deletion fails
  exactly for the deleted key or keys that failed before.
- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_search_false_old`: old unsuccessful searches
  remain unsuccessful after deletion.
- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_not_mem_iff`: membership after deletion fails
  exactly for the deleted key or keys that were absent before.
- Theorems {lit}`BTree.delete_not_mem_old` and
  {lit}`BTree.delete_not_mem_of_eq`: old absent keys and keys equal to the
  deleted key remain absent after deletion.
- Theorems {lit}`BTree.delete_not_mem` and
  {lit}`BTree.delete_search_deleted_false`: the deleted key is absent and not
  searchable after deletion.
- Theorems {lit}`BTree.delete_mem_of_ne` and
  {lit}`BTree.delete_search_of_ne`: old keys different from the deleted key
  remain present and searchable after deletion.

Current gaps:

- Node-level underflow repair, sibling borrowing, merging, and disk-page
  semantics remain strengthening targets.
