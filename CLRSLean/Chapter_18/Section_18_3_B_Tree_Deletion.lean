# CLRS Section 18.3 - B-tree deletion specification

This section adds a first-pass deletion specification over the mathematical
B-tree key-membership model.  It deliberately stays at the set-membership layer:
the operation filters the represented key list and later refinements can replace
it with the full CLRS node-level borrow/merge algorithm.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_preserves_model`: specification deletion preserves
  the first-pass validity predicate.
- Theorem {lit}`BTree.delete_mem_iff`: after deletion, membership is exactly
  membership of a key different from the deleted key.

Current gaps:

- Node-level underflow repair, sibling borrowing, merging, and disk-page
  semantics remain strengthening targets.
