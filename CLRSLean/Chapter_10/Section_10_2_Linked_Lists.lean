# CLRS Section 10.2 - Linked lists

This section uses ordinary Lean lists as the mathematical model of a linked
list.  It captures the lookup, front insertion, and deletion-by-key behavior
that CLRS proves informally before one adds pointer fields and memory
allocation.

Main results:

- Theorem {lit}`listSearch_sound`: a successful search returns an element from
  the input list satisfying the predicate.
- Theorem {lit}`mem_listInsert_self`: inserting at the front makes the inserted
  element a member.
- Theorem {lit}`mem_listDeleteAll_iff`: deleting all nodes with a key gives the
  expected membership characterization.

Current gaps:

- Pointer-level predecessor/successor updates and free-list allocation are
  deferred to a future imperative-memory model.

/-- Search a list for the first element satisfying a Boolean predicate. -/

  | x :: xs => if p x then some x else listSearch p xs

/-- Insert an element at the head of a linked list. -/

  x :: xs

/-- Delete every node whose key equals {lit}`x`. -/
def listDeleteAll [DecidableEq α] (x : α) (xs : List α) : List α :=
  xs.filter fun y => y != x

/-! ## Search correctness -/

/-- A successful search returns a member of the input list satisfying the predicate. -/

/-- The inserted element is a member of the resulting list. -/

/-- Delete-all has the expected membership characterization. -/
