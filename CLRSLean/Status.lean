# Proof Status

This page is the public status ledger for the web site.  It mirrors the longer
maintainer notes in `docs/proof-map.md`, but is written for readers who are
navigating the deployed pages.

## Status Labels

* `proved`: the named section theorem is proved in Lean for the current
  specification.
* `expository`: a reader-facing guide page with no theorem target.
* `partial`: important theorem infrastructure exists, but the full textbook
  claim is not complete.
* `statement`: the intended theorem interface exists, but proof work has not
  started.
* `blocked-design`: progress depends on choosing a stable representation.
* `blocked-mathlib`: progress depends on missing or inconvenient Mathlib
  infrastructure.
* `deferred-implementation`: the mathematical proof is in scope, but a
  low-level implementation proof is postponed.
* `future-work`: exercises, chapter-end problems, or strengthening passes
  outside the current main track.

## Proved

* 3.1 Asymptotic notation:
  `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigO_iff`,
  `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_iff`,
  `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigOmega_iff`,
  `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleOmega_iff`,
  `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigTheta_trans`.
* 4.5 Master method, exact-power model:
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter04.h_formula`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter04.master_case1_geometric`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter04.master_case2_constant_forcing`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter04.master_case3_tail_dominated`.
* 5.1 Hiring problem, finite rank-symmetry model:
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter05.uniformAverage_indicator_singleton`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter05.hireProbability_eq`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter05.expectedHiresByIndicators_eq_harmonic`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter05.expectedHires_eq_harmonic`.
* 2.1 Insertion sort:
  `CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_sorted`,
  `CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_perm`.
* 2.2 Analyzing algorithms:
  `CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSortWorstComparisons_quadratic`.
* 2.3 Designing algorithms:
  `CLRS.Chapter02.mergeSort_sortedLE`,
  `CLRS.Chapter02.mergeSort_perm`,
  `CLRS.Chapter02.mergeSortRecurrenceOnPowersOfTwo_closedForm`.
* 16.3 Huffman codes:
  `CLRS.HuffmanV2.optimum_huffman_freqs`.
* 10.1 Stacks and queues:
  `CLRS.Chapter10.pop_push`,
  `CLRS.Chapter10.dequeue_enqueue_empty`,
  `CLRS.Chapter10.dequeue_enqueue_nonempty`.
* 10.2 Linked lists:
  `CLRS.Chapter10.listSearch_sound`,
  `CLRS.Chapter10.mem_listInsert_self`,
  `CLRS.Chapter10.mem_listDeleteAll_iff`.
* 11.1 Direct-address tables:
  `CLRS.Chapter11.search_insert_same`,
  `CLRS.Chapter11.search_insert_other`,
  `CLRS.Chapter11.search_delete_same`,
  `CLRS.Chapter11.search_delete_other`.

## Partial

* 3.2 Standard functions:
  current results {lit}`CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_pow_pow`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter03.isBigO_pow_pow`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter03.isBigTheta_nat_floor_coerce`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter03.isBigTheta_nat_ceil_coerce`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter03.factorial_upper_bound`, and
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_exp_vs_factorial`;
  remaining gap: add the full CLRS table of standard growth comparisons,
  especially logarithm-vs-polynomial and polynomial-vs-exponential facts.
* 11.2 Chained hash tables:
  current result {lit}`CLRS.Chapter11.hashSearch_hashInsert_self`;
  remaining gap: expected search time under simple uniform hashing needs a
  probability model over keys or hash functions.
* 12.1 Binary search trees:
  current results {lit}`CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.inTree_insert_iff` and
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.insert_ordered`;
  remaining gap: search, minimum/maximum, successor/predecessor, and deletion
  remain future section targets.
* 13.1 Red-black trees:
  current results {lit}`CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.inTree_rotateLeft_iff`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.inTree_rotateRight_iff`,
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.noRedRed_repaint_black`, and
  {lit}`CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.balancedBlackHeight_repaintRoot`;
  remaining gap: full RB insertion/deletion fixup algorithms are not yet
  mechanized.
* 16.1 Activity selection:
  current results {lit}`CLRS.ActivitySelection.earliest_finish_minFinish` and
  {lit}`CLRS.ActivitySelection.greedy_choice_optimal_from_certificate`;
  remaining gap: derive the exchange certificate automatically from a
  finish-time-sorted input interface and prove the full recursive
  {lit}`CLRS.ActivitySelection.greedySelect` theorem.
* 23.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree:
  current result `CLRS.MST.safe_edge_of_lightest_crossing`;
  remaining gap: construct the concrete exchange edge from finite graph paths
  or cycles.
* 23.2 Kruskal and Prim:
  current result `CLRS.MST.kruskal_optimal`;
  remaining gap: derive lightness from sorted order and prove the final selected
  set is a spanning tree.

## Deferred or Blocked

* Union-find correctness: `deferred-implementation`.
  Reason: not needed for the mathematical MST proof.
* Concrete MST exchange edge: `blocked-design`.
  Reason: needs a stable finite path or walk representation.
* Full RAM semantics: `future-work`.
  Reason: requires a separate imperative machine and cost model.
* Chapter 4 maximum subarray, Strassen, substitution, and recursion-tree
  sections: `future-work`.
  Reason: these sections are formalizable but still need their own models:
  interval sums, block matrices, and reusable recurrence-tree infrastructure.
* Chapter 4 extension from exact powers to all input sizes: `future-work`.
  Reason: needs a monotone recurrence model and floor/ceiling sandwiching.
* Chapter 5 logarithmic harmonic-number asymptotics: `future-work`.
  Reason: useful strengthening beyond the current finite rank-symmetry theorem.
* General merge-sort recurrence: `future-work`.
  Reason: needs floor and ceiling arithmetic for all input sizes.
* CLRS exercises and chapter-end problems: `future-work`.
  Reason: kept separate from the first main-theorem pass.

## Reader Contract

The status table is intentionally conservative.  A section is not marked
`proved` merely because the algorithm idea is clear; it needs a named Lean
theorem that compiles for the stated model.  A section marked `partial` should
say exactly which mathematical or representation layer remains.
