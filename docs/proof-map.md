# CLRS-Lean Proof Map

This ledger records what is proved, what is partial, and what is currently
deferred.  It is intended to become the website's main navigation table.

## Chapter 1 - The Role of Algorithms

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_01.lean`
- Status: `expository`
- Main theorem: none
- Current gap: none; theorem-bearing work starts in later chapters

This page explains the project contract: translate each selected textbook claim
into a Lean-friendly model, expose a public theorem interface, prove it, and
record the status honestly.

## Chapter 2 - Getting Started

### Section 2.1 - Insertion sort

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_02/Section_02_1_Insertion_Sort.lean`
- Status: `proved`
- Main theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_sorted`
  - `CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_perm`
- Proof pattern: induction, sortedness preservation, permutation preservation
- Current gap: none for the current functional-list theorem statement

The section proves functional correctness for insertion sort over lists of
natural numbers.  The proof mirrors the textbook loop invariant by separating
orderedness from element preservation.

### Section 2.2 - Analyzing algorithms

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_02/Section_02_2_Analyzing_Algorithms.lean`
- Status: `proved`
- Main theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSortWorstComparisons_quadratic`
  - `CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSortWorstComparisons_eventually_quadratic`
- Proof pattern: triangular sum, natural-number inequalities, asymptotic wrapper
- Current gap: full RAM semantics and exact line-by-line pseudocode cost are
  future strengthening targets

The section proves that the standard insertion-sort worst-case comparison count
is bounded by a quadratic function.

### Section 2.3 - Designing algorithms

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_02/Section_02_3_Designing_Algorithms.lean`
- Status: `proved`
- Main theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter02.mergeSort_sortedLE`
  - `CLRS.Chapter02.mergeSort_perm`
  - `CLRS.Chapter02.mergeSortRecurrenceOnPowersOfTwo_closedForm`
- Proof pattern: divide and conquer, sortedness, permutation preservation,
  recurrence solving
- Current gap: arbitrary-size floor/ceiling recurrence and full RAM execution
  cost are future strengthening targets

The section proves functional correctness for merge sort using Lean's verified
`List.mergeSort` implementation.  It also proves the exact closed form of the
standard recurrence on input sizes `2^k`.

## Chapter 3 - Growth of Functions

### Section 3.1 - Asymptotic notation

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_03/Section_03_1_Asymptotic_Notation.lean`

  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigOmega_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleOmega_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigTheta_trans`
- Proof pattern: bridge CLRS discrete witnesses to Mathlib filters
- Current gap: none for the wrapper interface

The section gives CLRS-facing names for O, Ω, Θ, o, and ω over functions
`ℕ → ℝ`, proves the textbook-style witness forms, and collects basic algebraic
rules.

### Section 3.2 - Standard functions

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_03/Section_03_2_Standard_Functions.lean`
- Status: `partial`
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_pow_pow`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigO_pow_pow`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_pow_const_exp`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_log_rpow`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_exp_exp_of_lt`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isEquivalent_harmonic_log`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigTheta_harmonic_log`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigTheta_nat_floor_coerce`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isBigTheta_nat_ceil_coerce`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.factorial_upper_bound`
  - `CLRS.Chapter03.isLittleO_exp_vs_factorial`
- Proof pattern: reuse Mathlib asymptotic and factorial facts through the CLRS
  wrappers
- Current gap: half-scale floor/ceiling facts, lower factorial bounds,
  and the rest of the CLRS standard-function table remain strengthening
  targets.

This section is the safe part of the `chapter-1-exploration` branch merged into
the main site.  It compiles, but it is not yet the whole Chapter 3 growth
library.

## Chapter 4 - Divide and Conquer

Chapter 4 is not limited to the Master-method file.  The current development
now includes a maximum-subarray specification theorem and a recurrence layer
for the substitution and recursion-tree proof methods.  Strassen and the full
all-input Master Theorem still need separate models.

### Section 4.1 - The maximum-subarray problem

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_04/Section_04_1_Maximum_Subarray.lean`
- Status: `proved` for the exhaustive-search specification
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.mem_nonemptySubarrays_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.bestCandidate_correct`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.maxSubarray_exists_of_ne_nil`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.maxSubarray_correct`
- Proof pattern: enumerate all nonempty contiguous subarrays, prove the
  enumerator exact, then prove finite argmax optimality
- Current gap: prove the CLRS divide-and-conquer pseudocode as an implementation
  refinement of this specification, then add runtime analysis

### Section 4.2 - Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication

- Lean source: not yet created
- Status: `future-work`
- Planned theorem target: the seven Strassen products reconstruct ordinary
  block matrix multiplication
- Proof pattern: block matrix algebra, ring normalization, dimension bookkeeping
- Current gap: choose a matrix/block representation with manageable dimensions

### Section 4.3 - The substitution method

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_04/Section_04_3_Substitution_Method.lean`
- Status: `proved` for one-step recurrence bounds
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.substitution_upper_bound`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.substitution_lower_bound`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.substitution_sandwich`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.linear_substitution_upper_bound`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.geometric_substitution_upper_bound`
- Proof pattern: ordinary induction over the recurrence index; the guessed
  bound is treated as an invariant preserved by one recurrence step
- Current gap: floor/ceiling and multi-branch recurrences should instantiate
  these lemmas after deriving the appropriate one-step inequality

### Section 4.4 - The recursion-tree method

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_04/Section_04_4_Recursion_Tree_Method.lean`
- Status: `proved` for additive level-cost expansions
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.recursion_tree_additive_unroll`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.recursion_tree_additive_upper_envelope`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.recursion_tree_additive_lower_envelope`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.recursion_tree_constant_level_cost`
- Proof pattern: finite sum induction, then envelope bounds on the level costs
- Current gap: branching recurrences such as `T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)` should
  first group each recursion depth into one level-cost function before using
  this additive core

### Section 4.5 - The master method

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_04/Section_04_5_Master_Theorem.lean`
- Status: `proved` for exact-power recurrences
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.h_formula`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.master_case1_geometric`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.master_case2_constant_forcing`
  - `CLRS.Chapter04.master_case3_tail_dominated`
- Proof pattern: unroll the exact-power recurrence after dividing by `a^i`,
  then prove bounded, constant, and tail-dominated normalized-forcing criteria
- Current gap: extending exact powers `n = b^i` to all input sizes needs a
  monotone recurrence model and floor/ceiling sandwiching

### Section 4.6 - Proof of the master theorem

- Lean source: not yet created
- Status: `future-work`
- Planned theorem target: full CLRS Master Theorem for all natural input sizes,
  derived from the exact-power core plus floor/ceiling bounds
- Proof pattern: monotone recurrence sandwiching, regularity hypotheses,
  asymptotic transfer from powers to all inputs
- Current gap: the exact-power cases compile, but the all-input-size bridge is
  not yet mechanized

## Chapter 5 - Probabilistic Analysis and Randomized Algorithms

### Section 5.1 - The hiring problem

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_05/Section_05_1_Hiring_Problem.lean`
- Status: `proved` for the finite rank-symmetry model
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter05.uniformAverage_indicator_singleton`
  - `CLRS.Chapter05.hireProbability_eq`
  - `CLRS.Chapter05.expectedHiresByIndicators_eq_harmonic`
  - `CLRS.Chapter05.expectedHires_eq_harmonic`
  - `CLRS.Chapter05.harmonic_isBigTheta_log`
  - `CLRS.Chapter05.expectedHires_isBigTheta_log`
- Proof pattern: compute singleton probability in a finite uniform rank space,
  sum indicator expectations, prove the equivalent recurrence by induction, and
  transfer the Chapter 3.2 harmonic-number Θ theorem to expected hires
- Current gap: none for the current finite rank-symmetry model; a lower-level
  random-permutation and pseudocode execution model remains a future refinement

## Chapter 10 - Elementary Data Structures

### Section 10.1 - Stacks and queues

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_10/Section_10_1_Stacks_And_Queues.lean`
- Status: `proved` for the functional-list model
- Main theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.pop_push`
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.dequeue_enqueue_empty`
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.dequeue_enqueue_nonempty`
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.length_enqueue`
- Proof pattern: definitional equations over list-backed stacks and queues
- Current gap: array overflow/underflow, circular buffers, and RAM costs are
  deferred to a future execution model

The section proves the algebraic behavior of stacks and queues using lists:
stack top is list head, and queue front is list head with enqueue at the back.

### Section 10.2 - Linked lists

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_10/Section_10_2_Linked_Lists.lean`
- Status: `proved` for the functional-list model
- Main theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.listSearch_sound`
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.mem_listInsert_self`
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.mem_listInsert_of_mem`
  - `CLRS.Chapter10.mem_listDeleteAll_iff`
- Proof pattern: list recursion, membership preservation, filter membership
- Current gap: predecessor/successor pointer updates and free-list allocation
  require an imperative memory model

## Chapter 11 - Hash Tables

### Section 11.1 - Direct-address tables

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_11/Section_11_1_Direct_Address_Tables.lean`
- Status: `proved` for the functional table model
- Main theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.search_insert_same`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.search_insert_other`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.search_delete_same`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.search_delete_other`
- Proof pattern: total functions, point update by `if`
- Current gap: bounded arrays and RAM costs are deferred

### Section 11.2 - Chained hash tables

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_11/Section_11_2_Chained_Hash_Tables.lean`
- Status: `partial`
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.bucket_hashInsert_same`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.bucket_hashInsert_other`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.bucket_hashDelete_same`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.bucket_hashDelete_other`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.hashSearch_hashInsert_self`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.hashSearch_hashInsert_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.hashSearch_hashDelete_self`
  - `CLRS.Chapter11.hashSearch_hashDelete_iff`
- Proof pattern: deterministic bucket update/delete for a fixed hash function
- Current gap: expected search time under simple uniform hashing requires a
  probability model over keys or hash functions

## Chapter 12 - Binary Search Trees

### Section 12.1 - Binary search trees

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_12/Section_12_1_Binary_Search_Trees.lean`
- Status: `partial`
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.search_eq_true_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.minimum?_inTree`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.minimum?_le_of_ordered`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.maximum?_inTree`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.le_maximum?_of_ordered`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.successor?_least_greater`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.predecessor?_greatest_less`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.inTree_insert_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.inTree_insert_self`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.insert_ordered`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.inTree_delete_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter12.BSTree.delete_ordered`
- Proof pattern: inductive tree membership, bound predicates, ordered invariant,
  extremal-path recursion, and successor-replacement deletion
- Current gap: parent-pointer successor/predecessor procedures, transplant,
  and pointer-level mutation remain future section targets

This section proves the core ordered-tree interface: search is equivalent to
membership, minimum/maximum return actual extremal keys, functional
successor/predecessor return least-greater/greatest-less keys, insertion adds
exactly one key, and functional deletion removes exactly the requested key while
preserving the BST ordering invariant.

## Chapter 13 - Red-Black Trees

### Section 13.1 - Red-black trees

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_13/Section_13_1_Red_Black_Trees.lean`
- Status: `partial`
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.inTree_rotateLeft_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.inTree_rotateRight_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.inTree_repaintRoot_iff`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.red_node_children_black`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.noRedRed_repaint_black`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.balancedBlackHeight_repaintRoot`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.balancedBlackHeight_rotateLeft_red_red`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.balancedBlackHeight_rotateRight_red_red`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.redBlackShape_repaint_rotateLeft_red_red`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.redBlackShape_repaint_rotateRight_red_red`
  - `CLRS.Chapter13.RBTree.redBlackShape_repaint_black`
- Proof pattern: local colored-tree invariants, rotations, root recoloring,
  and red-red rotation repair certificates
- Current gap: full `RB-INSERT`, `RB-INSERT-FIXUP`, `RB-DELETE`, and
  `RB-DELETE-FIXUP` are not mechanized

The section builds the local invariant library needed before mechanizing the
full balancing algorithms.

## Chapter 16 - Greedy Algorithms

### Section 16.1 - Activity selection

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_16/Section_16_1_Activity_Selection.lean`
- Status: `partial`
- Main proved theorems:
  - `CLRS.ActivitySelection.earliest_finish_minFinish`
  - `CLRS.ActivitySelection.finishSorted_head_minFinish`
  - `CLRS.ActivitySelection.finishSorted_activitiesAfter`
  - `CLRS.ActivitySelection.greedySelect_sublist`
  - `CLRS.ActivitySelection.greedySelect_feasible`
  - `CLRS.ActivitySelection.greedy_choice_optimal_from_certificate`
- Proof pattern: finish-time order, earliest-finish greedy choice, recursive
  sublist/feasibility invariants, and certificate-based exchange argument
- Current gap: derive the `GreedyChoiceCertificate` automatically and prove the
  full recursive `greedySelect` maximum-cardinality theorem without an external
  certificate.

The section proves the core finite-list model and the Lean-friendly
greedy-choice theorem for CLRS activity selection.  It also proves that the
recursive executable selector returns a feasible sublist of the input.  The
optimality theorem still deliberately exposes the exchange certificate as an
explicit hypothesis, making the remaining automation target precise rather than
hidden inside an incomplete theorem statement.

### Section 16.3 - Huffman codes

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_16/Section_16_3_Huffman_Codes.lean`
- Status: `proved`
- Main theorem: `HuffmanV2.optimum_huffman_freqs`
- Proof pattern: greedy exchange argument, split-leaf transformation
- Current gap: none for the current theorem statement

The section proves that Huffman coding produces an optimal prefix tree for a
nonempty frequency table with distinct symbols and positive frequencies.

## Chapter 23 - Minimum Spanning Trees

### Section 23.1 - Growing a minimum spanning tree

- Lean source:
  `CLRSLean/Chapter_23/Section_23_1_Growing_Minimum_Spanning_Trees.lean`
- Status: `partial`
- Main proved theorem: `CLRS.MST.safe_edge_of_lightest_crossing`
- Supporting theorem: `CLRS.MST.mst_exchange_step`
- Proof pattern: cut property, safe edge, exchange argument
- Current gap: the concrete path/cycle lemma that constructs the exchange edge
  from a finite graph spanning tree is still an explicit certificate.

This section contains the mathematical core of the CLRS MST proof.  It proves
that a light edge crossing a cut is safe once the graph-specific exchange
certificate is supplied.

### Section 23.2 - Kruskal and Prim

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_23/Section_23_2_Kruskal_And_Prim.lean`
- Status: `partial`
- Main proved theorem: `CLRS.MST.kruskal_optimal`
- Supporting theorem: `CLRS.MST.FiniteGraph.kruskal_optimal`
- Proof pattern: safe-edge induction over an edge list
- Deferred implementation: union-find correctness
- Current gaps:
  - derive lightness automatically from a sorted edge order;
  - prove the final selected edge set is a spanning tree from connectedness and
    complete edge scan;
  - add Prim's algorithm theorem interface.

The section currently proves a mathematical Kruskal skeleton: if accepted edges
come with safe-edge certificates and the final selected set is a spanning tree,
then the result is optimal.

## Deferred And Blocked Items

| Item | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Union-find implementation correctness | `deferred-implementation` | Not needed for the mathematical MST correctness theorem. |
| Activity-selection sorted-order exchange certificate | `partial` | Needs a sorted-by-finish interface that derives the current certificate automatically. |
| Sorted-order lightness for Kruskal | `partial` | Needs a list-order invariant over processed edges. |
| Maximum-subarray divide-and-conquer refinement | `future-work` | Exhaustive-search optimality is proved; the CLRS pseudocode and runtime recurrence still need to refine that specification. |
| Chapter 4 extension from exact powers to all input sizes | `future-work` | Needs a monotone recurrence model and floor/ceiling sandwiching. |
| Hash-table expected-time analysis | `blocked-design` | Needs a probability model for simple uniform hashing. |
| Pointer-level linked lists and free lists | `future-work` | Requires an imperative memory model. |
| BST transplant and parent-pointer navigation | `future-work` | Functional successor/predecessor queries and functional deletion are proved; pointer-transplant semantics remain. |
| Full red-black insertion/deletion | `blocked-design` | Needs a balancing representation and invariant-preservation proof across fixup cases. |
| Concrete MST exchange edge from paths | `blocked-design` | Needs a stable finite path/walk representation. |
| Prim's algorithm | `statement` | Section file exists only through the Chapter 23.2 target; theorem interface has not been added yet. |
| CLRS exercises | `future-work` | Keep the first pass focused on main textbook claims; add exercises after section interfaces stabilize. |
| Chapter-end problems | `future-work` | Treat as a second track with explicit priority and difficulty labels. |
| Full RAM semantics | `future-work` | Requires an imperative machine/cost semantics rather than only mathematical functions and recurrences. |
| General merge-sort recurrence | `future-work` | Needs floor/ceiling arithmetic and an asymptotic theorem for all input sizes. |

## Publication Value

The proof map is intentionally honest.  Completed sections show theorem names
that compile.  Partial sections expose the exact missing mathematical or
representation layer.  This lets future contributors pick a section without
reverse-engineering the project state.
