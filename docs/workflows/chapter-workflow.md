# CLRS Chapter Workflow

This is the working loop for each CLRS section.

## 1. Textbook Section Map

Record the relevant CLRS section number, title, algorithms, theorem-like claims,
and proof method.  Do not start with Lean code before the section has a clear
target statement.

Separate the map into three tracks:

- main textbook claims for the current pass;
- exercises, marked as future work unless explicitly selected;
- chapter-end Problems, marked as future work with priority and difficulty.

## 2. Algorithm Understanding

Translate the textbook algorithm into a Lean-friendly model.  Prefer a
mathematical version first.  Low-level implementation details such as arrays,
heaps, or union-find can be deferred when they are not needed for the main
correctness theorem.

## 3. Mathematical Proof Plan

Write the human proof in small claims.  For sorting algorithms, this usually
means:

- sortedness;
- preservation of elements, usually via permutation;
- induction or loop invariant.

For graph algorithms, this may mean:

- invariant;
- exchange lemma;
- cut or path certificate;
- final optimality theorem.

## 4. Lean Interface

Write the theorem names first and check that the intended public API is small.
The interface should answer what a future reader would search for:

```lean
#check CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_sorted
#check CLRS.Chapter02.insertionSort_perm
```

## 5. Lean Proof

Prove helper lemmas only when they serve the public theorem.  Keep early files
local and readable.  Extract shared abstractions only after at least two sections
need them.

## 6. Verification

Run the narrow file check, the interface check, and the library build when the
environment has Mathlib available:

```bash
lake env lean CLRSLean/Chapter_02/Section_02_1_Insertion_Sort.lean
lake env lean Tests/Chapter_02_Interface.lean
lake build CLRSLean
```

## 7. Update The Map

Update:

- `docs/proof-map.md`;
- the relevant `docs/chapters/chapter-XX.md`;
- `docs/site/index.html` if the section should appear on the static preview.

Every section should say whether it is `proved`, `partial`, `statement`,
`blocked-design`, `blocked-mathlib`, `deferred-implementation`,
`future-work`, or `out-of-scope`.
