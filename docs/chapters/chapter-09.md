# Chapter 9 - Medians and Order Statistics

Chapter 9 now has compiler-clean correctness interfaces for the specification
selector, a pivot-style quickselect model, and a pivot-parametric deterministic
SELECT model.  It also now proves the local five-element median certificate
that starts the CLRS median-of-medians split-size argument.

## Section 9.2 - Selection by rank

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_09/Section_09_2_Select_By_Rank.lean`
- Status: `proved` for the specification selector and pivot-style quickselect
- Main theorem: `CLRS.Chapter09.quickSelect?_correct`

The section keeps the simple specification selector: sort the input list and
read the zero-based rank `k`.  It also proves a fuelled quickselect model that
uses the first element as a pivot and recursively keeps the `< pivot` or
`> pivot` side, with the middle pivot block represented by the interval
`ltCount pivot xs ≤ k < leCount pivot xs`.

The theorem layer proves:

- `CLRS.Chapter09.sortedCopy_perm`: sorting preserves exactly the input
  elements.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.sortedCopy_pairwise`: the sorted copy is pairwise ordered.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.selectByRank?_mem`: any returned value came from the input.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.selectByRank?_rankCorrect`: the returned value satisfies the
  order-statistic count certificate.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.selectByRank?_correct`: the reader-facing correctness wrapper.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.quickSelect?_mem`: any quickselect result came from the input.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.quickSelect?_rankCorrect`: pivot-style quickselect satisfies
  the same rank certificate.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.quickSelect?_correct`: the reader-facing quickselect wrapper.

The rank certificate handles duplicates in the standard way.  If the returned
value is `x`, then the number of input elements strictly smaller than `x` is at
most `k`, and the number of input elements at most `x` is greater than `k`.

## Section 9.3 - Deterministic selection

- Lean source: `CLRSLean/Chapter_09/Section_09_3_Deterministic_Select.lean`
- Status: `proved` for pivot-parametric deterministic SELECT correctness and
  the local five-element median certificate
- Main theorem: `CLRS.Chapter09.deterministicSelect?_correct`

The section abstracts SELECT over a pivot rule.  The only required hypothesis is
that the pivot rule returns a member of the current input list.  Under that
assumption, the recursive selector preserves the Chapter 9.2 rank certificate
through the `< pivot`, pivot-block, and `> pivot` branches.

The theorem layer proves:

- `CLRS.Chapter09.selectWithPivot?_mem`: any successful pivot-parametric SELECT
  result came from the input.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.selectWithPivot?_rankCorrect`: pivot-parametric SELECT
  satisfies the order-statistic count certificate.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.selectWithPivot?_correct`: the reader-facing wrapper for any
  membership-safe pivot rule.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.medianOfFive?_certificate`: for any five-element group, the
  rank-2 selector returns an input median with at least three elements at most
  it and at least three elements at least it.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.deterministicPivot?_mem`: the deterministic median-pivot rule
  returns only input elements.
- `CLRS.Chapter09.deterministicSelect?_correct`: the deterministic median-pivot
  SELECT instance satisfies the same rank certificate.

## Hard Follow-Up Work

- Randomized SELECT expected time: requires a probability model for randomized
  pivots and a cost recurrence or indicator argument.
- Deterministic linear-time SELECT: the rank-correct deterministic interface
  and local five-element median certificate are proved, but the global CLRS
  median-of-medians split-size bounds and recurrence analysis remain.
