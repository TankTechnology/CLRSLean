# CLRS-Lean Site Architecture

This document records the Scheme B site design: CLRS-Lean is deployed as a
book-style Verso site rather than as a collection of unrelated proof pages.

The public project and repository name is `CLRS-Lean`.  The Lean module root
remains `CLRSLean`, so source paths and imports continue to use `CLRSLean/...`
and `CLRSLean.Chapter_...`.

## Goals

- Make the deployed site easy to read from the homepage.
- Keep deployment simple: Lean source plus Verso, no separate frontend app.
- Give readers an honest status ledger for proved, partial, blocked, and
  deferred work.
- Keep maintainers aligned on which files change when a section is added.

## Information Architecture

```text
CLRSLean.lean                         project landing page
CLRSLean/Chapter_02.lean              Chapter 2 guide
CLRSLean/Chapter_16.lean              Chapter 16 guide
CLRSLean/Chapter_23.lean              Chapter 23 guide
CLRSLean/Status.lean                  web-facing proof status ledger
CLRSLean/Workflow.lean                contributor workflow
CLRSLean/Chapter_xx/Section_xx_y.lean section-level literate proof
docs/proof-map.md                     longer maintainer ledger
docs/workflows/chapter-workflow.md    maintainer workflow notes
```

## Deployment Path

```text
Lean literate source
-> lake build
-> lake build :literateHtml
-> scripts/optimize_literate_html.py
-> _site
-> GitHub Pages
```

`literate.toml` controls the sidebar order and page titles.  The public website
should not depend on a hand-written `docs/site/index.html`.

Large generated proof pages are post-processed before deployment.  The optimizer
keeps anchors, rendered Lean code, search assets, and copy buttons, while
removing tactic-state DOM and hover metadata that make browser parsing slow on
long files such as the Huffman proof.

## Reader Flow

Readers should be able to move in three ways:

1. Project overview: homepage -> chapter guide -> section proof.
2. Audit path: homepage -> Proof Status -> partial or blocked item.
3. Contributor path: homepage -> Workflow -> chapter guide -> section file.

## Update Rule

When a new CLRS section is added, update these files together:

- the section `.lean` file;
- its chapter guide page;
- `CLRSLean/Status.lean` if the proof status changes;
- `literate.toml` if it should appear in navigation;
- `docs/proof-map.md` for the longer maintainer record.
